Demonstration of the ng2-drag-drop-tree plugin. <br>
git clone <br>
npm install <br>
It's only starting at the moment. I will make it better with the feedback.

What needs to be done?
  -Fork primeng's drag drop to stop propagation
  -Allow custom CSS
  -Add better icons and CSS
  -Allow actions on multiple nodes
